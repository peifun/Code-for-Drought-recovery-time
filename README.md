Code for Drought recovery time
The Python codes are related to the article "The recovery time of natural forests under drought stress is longer than that of planted forests."
Steps 1–4 are the core codes for calculating drought recovery time, including "detrended_and _deseasonalized", "Calculation_of_the_pre-drought_mean","Identification_of_heatwave_events", and "Calculation_of_recovery_time".
Figures 3–5 are the codes for analyzing the driving factors of drought recovery time, including random forest, generalized additive models(GAMs), climate gradient analysis, residual analysis, and plotting partial dependence plots.
Note: The Python version is 3.9.
